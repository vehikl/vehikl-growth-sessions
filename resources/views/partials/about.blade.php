        <p>In <strong>"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"</strong> Stephen Covey tells the story of a hiker who
            was walking through a forest when they came across a frustrated lumberjack.</p>

        <p>The lumberjack was trying to cut down a tree with a saw and was swearing and cursing, labouring in vain.</p>

        <div class="my-4 ml-4">
            <p>“What’s the problem?” The hiker asked.</p>

            <p>“My saw’s blunt and won’t cut the tree properly.” The lumberjack responded.</p>

            <p>“Why don’t you just sharpen it?”</p>

            <p>“Because then I would have to stop sawing.” Said the lumberjack.</p>

            <p>“But if you sharpened your saw, you could cut more efficiently and effectively than before.”</p>

            <p>“But I don’t have time to stop!” The lumberjack retorted, getting even more frustrated.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The hiker shook his head and kept on walking, leaving the lumberjack to his pointless frustration.</p>

        chainsaw!). It is a space for experimenting, getting help when we are stuck, learning from others and
        sharing the benefits of what we have discovered in our travels.</p>
